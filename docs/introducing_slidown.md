# Introducing Slidown

## Before we start ...
## Here's a few quick tips
- Use a web browser that does not suck
- Enter full screen now
- Hit Spacebar or mouse button to advance

## This is Slidown

### a presentation platform for doing slideshows ...

### Online

### and composing with

### Markdown!

### Actually we created this little thing for ourselves,

### because in this weekend, we wanna make a presentation

###  as geeks!

### All started with a simple idea ...

### or maybe a few:

- We'd like to code a slide, not draw one
- We'd like to use markrdown to format text
- We'd like to focus on the content, not layouts
- We'd like to present it online, not with a projector

### and one of the coolest things is that we want to show it …

### on a phone or tablet

### and use it as a controller!

### So we started even before we got a spec

### and we wanna try out a new web framework called "Sinatra".

### Luckily we got a book which was very helpful.

### So …

- Somebody builds …
- Somebody designs ..
- Somebody deploys …
- Yeah, this is teamwork!

### And finally we made things happen!
### One more thing …

### Slidown is built on a  communicating framework

### We call it "Fowllow", our next big thing

### And our most talent platform architect is working on it!

### That's it. But now I have to say something to test the textbox ...

### Hope you could understand:
